Game Off 2018

A game developed for #GitHubGameOff.

Game was done quickly so pardon for poor coding practices and structuring :D

## Game Description
Take the role of a person trying to contain a pig within a lousy enclosure.

Use WSAD or Directional Arrows on the keyboard to control the gates to block the pig from escaping!

## Platforms
Game Link: [Link](https://angrypig-2018.firebaseapp.com/)

Game is devloped for the browser and mobile, although mobile controls might not be as clean as compared to the browser

## Known Bugs
- Sometimes when the pig touches exactly at the corners of the map, the resulting direction might go crazy
- Sometimes the game just starts flickering between the loading page and the game, just refresh the game to resolve that
- Sounds might fail
